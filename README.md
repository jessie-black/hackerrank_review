Basic practice getting back into routine of problem solving in python and java to prepare for coding interviews

## Purpose
It's been a few terms since my most recent courses in data structures and algorithm analyis (in Java) and I have primarily used Python in data science & data engineering context, so my grasp of data structures and algorithms is stronger in Java but could still use refreshing. This repository is therefore a combination of (1) reviewing basics and (2) identifying and closing language-specific knowledge gaps I may have between these 2 languages due to distinct usage contexts. In general, I'm selecting a language based on which seems more challenging (or less intuitive) to use for any given problem.
