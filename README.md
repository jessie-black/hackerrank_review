# hackerrank_review
Basic practice getting back into routine of problem solving in python and java to prepare for coding interviews

## Purpose
As I get ready to apply for positions, I want to work on my ability to problem-solve aloud and work through short challenges with Hacker Rank in both Python and Java, as it's been a while since I had to solve these issues in Java and I have primarily used Python in data science & data engineering context, so my grasp of data structures and algorithms is stronger in Java. This repository is therefore a combination of (1) reviewing basics and (2) identifying and closing language-specific knowledge gaps I may have between these 2 languages due to distinct usage contexts.
